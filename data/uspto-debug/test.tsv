10165723	Seed treatment apparatus	A seed treatment apparatus provides for minimal waste of products for treating seeds, in that it is precisely controllable and automatically adjustable. A volume of seeds to be treated and a flow rate of treatment product for treating the seeds can both be sensed. At least one of the flow rate of the treatment product and the volume of seeds can automatically be adjusted if it is determined that a ratio of the flow rate of treatment product to the volume of seeds is not the same as a predetermined flow rate to volume ratio.

10165759	VP trainer	A novel vp trainer for training and exercising dogs without the need for dog ever leaving a predetermined radius is disclosed herein. The vp trainer includes a telescopic pole, a handle grip on one end and a clip on the other end to attach a tug or an animal attachment such as a bird. For connecting to the telescopic pole, a tether is used inside the tug and animal attachments for integrity and durability.	['A01K']
10165819	Helmet accessory adapter	A system for use in connection with a protective helmet having at least one accessory connection mechanism includes a visor accessory which includes a frame including at least one rearward extending member. The system further includes an adapter including a helmet connector adapted to form a releasable connection with the accessory connection mechanism of the protective helmet and an accessory connector adapted to form a releasable connection with the at least one rearward extending member of the visor accessory. The accessory connector is adapted to be stowed on the at least one rearward extending member when the adapter is not in use to connect to the accessory connection mechanism of the protective helmet.

10165963	Hybrid electromagnetic-acoustic distal targeting system	A surgical targeting system of an intramedullary nail, which includes an extracorporeally arranged external transmitting unit. Further included is a plurality of first transponder units coupled with and arrayed along the length of the intramedullary nail, each adapted to be actuated by the external transmitting unit. Additionally, a plurality of holes are disposed within and arrayed along the length of the intramedullary nail. Each of the plurality of holes are situated between each of the plurality of first transponder units. Further, a first transmission section is between the external transmitting unit and each of the plurality of first transponder units via which the plurality of first transponder units are actuated. Additionally included is a second transmission section through the intramedullary nail between the plurality of first transponder units and a second transponder unit.	['A61N', 'A61B']
10165975	Pregnancy monitoring devices, systems, and related methods	Embodiments disclosed herein are directed to devices, systems, and methods for monitoring pregnancy of a female pregnant subject. For example, a pregnancy monitoring system can detect movement or motion of a pregnant subject and/or of the fetus in the pregnant subject. Additionally or alternatively, the pregnancy monitoring system can detect internal and/or external source loads applied to the pregnant subject. In an embodiment, the pregnancy monitoring system can compare and/or correlate two or more loads, one to another (e.g., to produce an output that is in part based on such comparison and that is related to the wellbeing of the pregnant subject and/or of the fetus). For example, the pregnancy monitoring system can include a controller that is configured to determine and compare two or more loads based on signals received from one or more sensors that can be positioned on the pregnant subject.

10166016	Medical retractor	Provided is a medical retractor capable of ensuring visibility in a field of operation and in the periphery of the field of operation while realizing the reduction of weight of the retractor compared to a conventional steel-made retractor. A medical retractor includes: a grip portion; and a resin functional portion made of a transparent resin and extending from the grip portion. The resin functional portion has: a trunk portion which has a proximal end thereof connected to the grip portion; and a hook-shaped portion extending in a hook shape from a distal end of the trunk portion. The resin functional portion is configured to allow the viewing of an affected part which opposedly faces a back surface of the resin functional portion from a front surface side in a see-through manner.

10166054	Bone fixation system	A modular bone fixation linkage includes a plurality of interconnected links that can angulate with respect to an adjacent one of the links about at least one axis, such as three axes. The links can further include fixation holes that are configured to receive bone anchors that secure the links to an underlying anatomical structure.	['A61B']
10166140	Liquid container and absorbent insert for oral negative-pressure therapy system	An oral negative-pressure therapy system includes a container and absorbent insert for the container. The container includes a baffle inside an interior of the container. A fluid passageway extends along the baffle for delivering fluid (e.g., a mixture of air and saliva) into the container. The absorbent insert for absorbing liquid (e.g., saliva) in the container may is over the baffle. At least one of the baffle and the absorbent insert is configured to maintain a fluid flow path between the baffle and the absorbent insert to maintain fluid communication between a fluid inlet and a fluid outlet of the container. The absorbent insert and/or the container may be designed and constructed to burst air bubbles in the aspirated liquid. In one or more embodiments, the absorbent insert is replaceable so that a spent absorbent insert can be replaced with a new, fresh absorbent insert.	['A61F', 'A61M', 'A61C']
10166254	Use of mesenchymal stem cell-educated macrophages to treat and prevent graft versus host disease and radiation-induced injury	The present invention relates to methods for treating and preventing graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and radiation-induced tissue damage or organ failure. More particularly, methods of the present invention comprise administering a therapeutically effective amount of mesenchymal stem cell-educated macrophages (MEMs) to a subject to treat or prevent GVHD, bone marrow failure, radiation-induced tissue damage or organ failure, or a condition associated with aberrant inflammation.	['A61K']
10166324	Methods and system for treating arthritis	Provided is an arthritis treatment method and an arthritis treatment system which can be effective for the short-term attainment of a pain relief effect. An arthritis treatment method includes an instrument introducing step of causing at least one instrument having a tubular shape to communicate with a lesion area in which crystal-induced arthritis occurs, and a treatment step of removing a causative agent of the crystal-induced arthritis from the lesion area by perfusion and discharge of a lavage fluid through the instrument.
