9854778	Alfalfa plant and seed corresponding to transgenic event KK 179-2 and methods for detection thereof	The present invention provides a transgenic alfalfa event KK179-2. The invention also provides cells, plant parts, seeds, plants, commodity products related to the event, and DNA molecules that are unique to the event and were created by the insertion of transgenic DNA into the genome of a alfalfa plant. The current invention also provides anti-sense-oriented RNA gene suppression agents in the form of a loop of anti-sense-oriented RNA that is produced in the cells of transgenic alfalfa. In addition, the invention also provides methods for detecting the presence of said alfalfa event nucleotide sequences in a sample, probes and primers for use in detecting nucleotide sequences that are diagnostic for the presence of said alfalfa event.

9854813	Rotor for alimentary dough kneader machines	A rotor for a kneading machine for alimentary doughs is provided. The rotor has a flat base formed of a plurality of arms and a plurality of mixing paddles restrained to the arms. The mixing paddles are pivotally mounted on the arms about respective axes (E, F) that are parallel to the flat base. The arms are movable between a first operating position, wherein they extend from the arms along a direction (V) that is generally perpendicular to the flat base, and a second operating position, wherein they extend from the arms in opposite directions substantially parallel to the flat base. When the rotor is mounted in a kneading machine, its paddles are proximate to a bottom of the container of the machine in the second operating position, thus acting to separate the dough.

9855023	Ultrasound system control panel and display lift	The control panel and display of a cart-borne ultrasound system are support by a lift which can be controlled to allow the control panel and display to be raised, lowered, and rotated. The lift has a first pivot elbow mounted to the ultrasound system cart and a second pivot elbow on which the control panel and display are mounted. A four-bar linkage is coupled between the pivot elbows which enables to control panel and display to be raised and lowered while maintaining the inclination of the control panel. The pivot elbows allow the control panel and display to be turned and rotated. A pair of hydraulic struts are mounted to the four-bar linkage to support the weight of the control panel and display. When a control button on the handle of the control panel is depressed the control panel and display can be freely raised, lowered and rotated. When the control button is released the pivot elbows and four-bar linkages are locked in their current positions.	['H05K', 'H01H', 'F16M', 'A61B']
9855135	Cell migration inhibition system	Generally, an intraocular implant and methods for treating an ocular condition. In particular, an intraocular implant which implanted between an intraocular lens and the surface of the posterior capsule of the eye inhibits migration of residual lens epithelial cells after cataract surgery by providing structural barriers to reduce posterior capsule opacification of the eye.
