6981340	Footwear protector	A device for protecting footwear of a motorcycle rider comprises a sole of a water impermeable material, an upper of bodily flexible material and an adjustable strap for securing the device to footwear of the rider. The device is typically worn on the left foot of the rider because motorcycle transmissions are shifted by the left foot, leaving a characteristic wear pattern on the left shoe or boot of the rider. The upper allows substantial air movement around the rider's footwear and may be partially or wholly insulated with a foam layer in the upper. Some embodiments provide greater air circulation and less insulation. Two types of adjustable straps are shown.	['A43B']
6981343	Extended liner shelf talker	A shelf talker includes adhesive on the upper back side thereof, and a small release liner bonded thereto. The liner is severed by a cut line into top and middle tabs atop the adhesive, and a lower tab is suspended from the middle tab without adhesive between the tab and label.	['G09F', 'Y10T']
6981391	Connector for accessories	A connector for accessories, etc, which is mounted on both ends of a long linear member, the connector comprising a male part and a female part, which can fit into and separate from each other, and wherein when the male part is inserted into the female part from a fitting opening, magnetic attraction causes a change in the positional relationship between the male part and the female part with the result that the male part cannot pass through the fitting opening of the female part.

6981393	Yarn feeders of flat knitting machine	Yarn feeders are arranged such that feeder case portions are slidably engaged with a knitting yarn guide rail disposed on an upper portion of needle beds, and can be selectively brought by a bringing device. Each of the feeder cases is provided with a switching mechanism for switching a yarn feeding port to a feeding position and a waiting position by swinging the port. The switching mechanism is operated at a time during which a yarn feeder selected by the bringing device is brought from a stop state in order to feed yarn. The yarn feeding port is switched from the waiting position to the feeding position, a swinging direction of the yarn feeding port to the waiting position, after it feeds yarn, is set, and the yarn feeding port can be switched from the feeding position to the waiting position in association with a selection cancel operation of the bringing device after the yarn is fed.

6981548	In situ thermal recovery from a relatively permeable formation	A method for treating a relatively permeable formation containing heavy hydrocarbons in situ may include providing heat from a first set of heat sources to a first section of the formation. The heat provided to the first section may pyrolyze at least some hydrocarbons in the first section. Heat may also be provided from a second set of heat sources to a second section of the formation. The heat provided to the second section may mobilize at least some hydrocarbons in the second section. A portion of the hydrocarbons from the second section may be induced to flow into the first section. A mixture of hydrocarbons may be produced from the formation. The produced mixture may include at least some pyrolyzed hydrocarbons.	['Y10T', 'E21B', 'Y02C']
6981623	Mechanism for engaging portable equipment against a belt clip	There is provided an engaging mechanism of a system in which the flange-like protrusion at the portable equipment is engaged with or locked to an engaging part at a belt clip, wherein both fitting and removing for the portable equipment are simplified. The system such that the flange 5 at the portable equipment 1 is constituted by the disc 6 and the annular frame 7, the protrusion 8 directed inwardly from the annular frame 7 with its circumferential sides being applied as slant surfaces 8b and 8c; the engaging plate 23 of the belt clip 21 (refer to FIG. 2) is provided with the engaging part 210 comprised of the frame 211 and the front plate 214 formed with the U-shaped recess 213, the engaging plate 23 is constituted by the cantilever beam 31 defined by the slit 30, the extremity end of the beam 31 is formed with the claw 29 with its upper side being applied as the slant surface 29a; when the flange 5 is fitted into the engaging part 210, the claw 29 is fitted inside the annular frame 7 to apply a locked state, and when the portable equipment 1 is turned by 180Â°, the protrusion 8 causes the claw 29 to be retracted and releases the locked state.

6981747	Fully upholstered, ready-to-assemble article of furniture	A fully upholstered, ready-to-assemble article of furniture which may be custom ordered by a consumer, packaged by the seller for shipment to the consumer by a parcel delivery service, and then assembled by the consumer from the packaged components. The article of furniture includes a frame of a plurality of interlocking, planar frame members which are secured together by fasteners received in push-in connector elements. Upholstery coverings, the design of which is custom selected by the consumer, are attached to the frame and secured to one another by hook and loop fasteners. Foam elements are received within a second plurality of upholstery covers which have large openings for receiving the foam elements to provide cushions for the article of furniture. The frame members, upholstery covers, and foam elements are packaged in first, second, and third containers, respectively, which are each light enough to be shipped for home delivery by a parcel delivery service.

6981779	Power tools	It is an object of the present invention to provide a technique for making the effective use of cooling air for a motor within a power tool in order to rationalize the structure of the power tool. The representative power tool may have a tool bit case, a tool bit, a drive motor and a cooling air guiding member. The tool bit is provided within the tool bit case and performs a predetermined operation on a workpiece. The drive motor drives the tool bit. The cooling air guiding member guides cooling air for cooling the drive motor to a work area of the workpiece to be worked on with the tool bit, when the cooling air is discharged into the tool bit case. By such construction, the representative power tool can have rationalized structure that cooling air for cooling the drive motor of the power tool can also be utilized to clean the work area of the power tool.
